      <h3>Overiew</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The new H-series operator’s station is spacious and comfortable with advanced ergonomics and a completely redesigned Turnaround system.</li>
        <li>The cab is 20% larger.</li>
        <li>19% increase in window areas for unsurpassed sightlines in all directions.</li>
        <li>50% more HVAC venting with refined temperature control and automatic defrost.</li>
        <li>Numbers don’t lie, but you’ve got to sit in the new seat and experience the next generation Turnaround –  effortless 220° rotation with pushbutton locking and unlocking in any postion. The small details like a climate controlled cup holder, and a place to hang your hat make long days feel shorter. The durable interior finish is easy to clean. The 5-point harness makes extreme terrain feel a little bit tamer.</li>
        <li>The 620H skidder is Tigercat FPT Tier 2 or Tier 4f powered. The Tier 4f engine conforms to the latest emissions standards in North America and Europe.</li>
        <li>With the Tier 2 engine option, Tigercat brings the benefits of Tigercat power and support to harvesting professionals around the world.</li>
        <li>Hydrostatic drive offers many advantages. Performance in tough terrain is excellent because full tractive effort is available at any engine speed, minimizing wheel spin and improving breakout performance. The operator appreciates simplified drive control with no gear shifting.</li>
        <li>Electronic control technology combined with Tigercat’s unique hydrostatic drive system allows the skidder to operate at variable engine rpm, automatically increasing engine speed when additional horsepower is demanded. The result is improved fuel economy.</li>
      </ul>
